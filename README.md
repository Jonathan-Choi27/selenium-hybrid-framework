## About The Project

The Selenium Hybrid Framework with Cucumber is a Java-based test automation framework built on top of Selenium WebDriver. It combines the best practices of data-driven and keyword-driven frameworks with the behaviour-driven development (BDD) approach of Cucumber, providing a flexible and efficient way to automate web application testing.

## Features

- Integrates with Cucumber for behaviour-driven development.
- Provides a modular and scalable architecture for test suites.
- Supports cross-browser testing using Selenium WebDriver.
- Offers easy integration with Continuous Integration (CI) tools like Jenkins.
- Generates detailed test reports with screenshots and logs.
- Supports parallel test execution for faster feedback.
